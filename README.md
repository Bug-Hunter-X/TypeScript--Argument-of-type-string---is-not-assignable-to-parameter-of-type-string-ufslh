# TypeScript Bug: Type Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where an array of strings is passed to a function expecting a single string.  The error message is: Argument of type 'string[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to correct the issue.  This example highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript to catch such errors during development.
